# TODO: remove me from the repo

FOR TUTORIAL

- stream logs
- check benchmark execution mlcube training exp ID
- if association request failed for some reason, delete private key (or at least check if rerunning the request will simply overwrite the key)
- define output folders in medperf storage (logs for both, weights for agg)
- adding email to CN currently could be challenging. THINK
  - ASSUMPTION: emails are not changed after signup

- We now have demo data url and hash in training exp (dummy) that we don't use.
  - what to say about this in miccai (I think no worries; it's hidden now)
- rethink/review about the following serializers and if necessary use atomic transactions
  - association creation (dataset-training, agg-training)
  - association approval (dataset-training, agg-training)
  - training experiment creation (creating keypair); this could move to approval
- public/private keys uniqueness constraint while blank; check django docs on how
- fix bug about association list; /home/hasan/work/openfl_ws/medperf-private/server/utils/views.py
- pull latest medperf main
- test agg and training exp owner being same user
  - basically, test the tutorial steps EXACTLY

AFTER TUTORIAL

- FOLLOWUP: collaborators doesn't use tensorboard logs.
- FOLLOWUP: show csr hash on approval is not necessary since now CSRs are transported securely
- test remote aggregator
- make network config better structured (URL to file? no, could be annoying.)
- move key generation after admin approval of training experiments.
- when the training experiment owner wants to "lock" the experiment
  - ask for confirmation? it's an easy command and after execution there is no going back; a mess if unintended.
- secretstorage gcloud

NOT SURE

- consider if we want to enable restarts and epochs/"fresh restarts" for training exps (it's hard)
- mlcube for agg alone

LATER / FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS

- root key thing.
- limit network access (for now we can rely on the review of the experiment owner)
- compatibility tests
- rethink if keys are always needed (just for exps where they on't need a custom cert)
- server side verification of CSRs (check common names)
  - later: the whole design might be changed
