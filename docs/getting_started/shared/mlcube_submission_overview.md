The MedPerf server registers an MLCube as metadata comprised of a set of files that can be retrieved from the internet. This means that before submitting an MLCube you have to host its files on the internet. The MedPerf client provides a utility to prepare the files of an MLCube that need to be hosted. You can refer to [this page](../concepts/mlcube_files.md) if you want to understand what the files are, but using the utility script is enough.
